**Check K-th Bit**

**Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 52.75%Submissions: 262K+Points: 2**

**Given two positive integer n and  k, check if the kth index bit of n is set or not. \
 Note: A bit is called set if it is 1. **

**Examples : **

**Input: n = 4, k = 0**

**Output: false**

**Explanation: Binary representation of 4 is 100, in which 0th index bit from LSB is not set. So, return false.**

**Input: n = 4, k = 2**

**Output: true**

**Explanation: Binary representation of 4 is 100, in which 2nd index bit from LSB is set. So, return true.**

**Input: n = 500, k = 3**

**Output: false**

**Explanation: Binary representation of 500 is 111110100, in which 3rd index bit from LSB is not set. So, return false.**

**Constraints: \
1 ≤ n ≤ 109 \
0 ≤ k ≤ 31**
