**Difficulty: BasicAccuracy: 47.64%Submissions: 73K+Points: 1**

**Given a non-negative number n . The problem is to set the rightmost unset bit in the binary representation of n.**

**Examples :**

**Input: n = 6**

**Output: 7**

**Explanation: The binary representation of 6 is 110. After setting right most bit it becomes 111 which is 7.**

**Input: n = 15**

**Output: 31**

**Explanation: The binary representation of 15 is 01111. After setting right most bit it becomes 11111 which is 31.**

**Expected Time Complexity: O(Logn) \
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)**

** \
Constraints: \
1 &lt;= n &lt;= 109**
