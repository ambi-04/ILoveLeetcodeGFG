**Bit Manipulation**

**Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 49.84%Submissions: 70K+Points: 2Average Time: 15m**

**Given a 32 bit unsigned integer num and an integer i. Perform following operations on the number - **

**1. Get ith bit**

**2. Set ith bit**

**3. Clear ith bit**

**Note : For better understanding, we are starting bits from 1 instead 0. (1-based). You have to print space three space separated values ( as shown in output without a line break) and do not have to return anything.**

**Examples :**

**Input: 70 3**

**Output: 1 70 66**

**Explanation: Bit at the 3rd position from LSB is 1. (1 0 0 0 1 1 0) .The value of the given number after setting the 3rd bit is 70. The value of the given number after clearing 3rd bit is 66. (1 0 0 0 0 1 0)**

**Input: 8 1**

**Output: 0 9 8**

**Explanation: Bit at the first position from LSB is 0. (1 0 0 0)  .The value of the given number after setting the 1st bit is 9. (1 0 0 1).  The value of the given number after clearing 1st bit is 8. (1 0 0 0)**

** **

**Constraints:**

**0&lt;=num&lt;=109**

**1&lt;=i&lt;=32**
